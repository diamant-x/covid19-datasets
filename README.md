# Covid19-datasets
COVID-19 Situation datasets from official states such as WHO Status Reports. Full traceability of the data is provided.

## Description
World Health Organization has become the centralizing agent to consolidate daily updates worldwide with reliable data. However, this data is not shared in an easily computer-ready format so performing additional analysis of such information requires additional maual work.

This repository aims to implement the code to scrap through the PDFs of the WHO status reports and save in a computer-friendly format such data for third party usage.

We are following the project structure found derived from [cookiecutter](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science#directory-structure)

## How to Use
You can find the processed files for machine-ready input at path https://github.com/diamant-x/who-covid19-datasets/tree/master/data/processed.
